The tree based graphical representation makes it easy to perform tasks like classification and regression.


So, how does it decide on decision nodes.





GiniUncertanity:
Maximizing this criterion can be interpreted as the
 maximization of the number of pairs of objects of the same class that are in the same subtree (not to be confused with the Gini index).




Entropy:
Its a measure of disorder. Higher entropy, the less order the system is.




Information Gain:
Higher the gain, higher the result.



Hyperparameters:

Max_Depth, Max features, Min_leaf.
